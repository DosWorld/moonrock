IBRARY 3.1, 02/01/96:

   This is the first release of IBRARY by Charon Software.



IBRARY 2.0, 02/28/94:

   This release adds scores of new routines, a new demo, and a
   printed manual for registered owners. It features a complete
   set of DOS directory and file handling services, control over
   the cursor size and visibility, keyboard toggles, text screen
   save/restore, convenient memory access, delays, new equipment
   detection routines, and other goodies. More than 200 routines
   in all!

   All IBRARY routines which access the disk include built-in
   critical error handling, so's to avoid having that nasty
   "A>bort, R>etry, I>gnore, F>ail" prompt interrupt your
   programs. Instead, critical errors cause an appropriate error
   code to be returned, so you can process them normally.

   shifts and rotates, equipment information, STR$ without
   leading blanks, access to BIOS and DOS interrupts, more.
