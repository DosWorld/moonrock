Thank you for registering!

SAMPLE diskettes are sent FREE with a registration.  For requests of specific
samples, please write them on the back side of the page.  NOTE:  Programs do
take up room.  You can only fit so many on a disk.  Please only request the
ones you REALLY want.  They will be taken in order.  Some programs are
included AUTOMATICALLY on the sample disk and as such are the first put on.
Your preference of the type(s) of programs or the programs to be requested
should be written on the back of this form (example:  Not everyone is a sysop
of a BBS and would not use a program designed for sysops...)

Registration names MUST be 40 letters or less...

        For example, "Chris Walker of Charon, The 10th Planet" barely fits.
                Another example would be "John Doe" or
                                     "George Miller of George's Place BBS"...
