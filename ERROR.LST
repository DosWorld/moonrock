      Moonrock errors (fatal)
      -----------------------
        1  MCB corrupt
             Something has corrupted MoonRock's memory structures.

        2  invalid pointer to free
             Internal error, or corrupted memory.

        3  overflow on calculation (debug only)
             A calculation has set the overflow processor status. The
             following will generate an overflow error if compiled with
             the /D option:
                a% = 10
                a% = a% + 32767

        4  invalid file handle
             An unknown file handle has been referenced.

        5  out of near memory
             The memory manager has insufficient free space to allocate
             the requested block of memory.

        6  invalid function call
             The 'catch all' error. Happens in many situations,
             including:
               * Attempting to CPUT or CGET a character off the screen
               * Attempting to save too many screens
               * Trying to put a pixel in a text mode
               * Trying to put or get a pixel that is off the screen

        7  array element out of bounds (debug only)
             The program has attempted to access an array element higher
             than was dimensioned.

        8  read past end of file
             Attempt to read data beyond the end of the file.

       10  error entering protected mode (DPMI only)
             A DPMI host was detected, but there was a problem entering
             protected mode.

       11  divide overflow / divide by zero (debug only)
             Your program has attempted to divide by zero, or the result
             of the division is too large to fit within a word.

       12  segment boundary overrun detected (debug only)
             Your program has attempted to read or write over the
             boundary of a segment. This error (when not checked for)
             often causes exception #13.

       13  unsupported screen mode
             Tried to set an unknown screen mode.

       ..  memory allocation error
             Memory initialisation at startup failed, due to corrupt
             DOS memory blocks, or insufficient memory.

       ..  program error: null pointer assignment
             A pointer was referenced (memory written to) but was not
             initialised with a pointer value. The following code
             demonstrates this:

                begin def
                pointer word word1~
                begin code
                [word1~] = 1 ' pointer not initialised

        .. program error: exception occurred in _atexit
             A runtime error occurred in a procedure called by atexit.
