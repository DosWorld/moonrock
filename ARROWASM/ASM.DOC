                                    INTRODUCTION
          
          Thank  you  for  trying  out  the  public  domain  version of our
          Arrowsoft Assembler.  We feel that the best way to alert you, the 
          programmer, to our fine line of professional products is  to  let
          you use one.  Once you have experienced the high quality and ease 
          of  use  of  this  free product, we hope that you will contact us
          regarding our other software (our address is on the cover of this 
          manual).  
          
          You will no doubt notice that this manual is not  exhaustive;  in
          fact,  it  includes  the  least  amount of information we felt we
          could include without robbing  the  program  of  its  usefulness.
          There  are  two reasons for the brevity of this manual: First, we
          have targeted professional software developers with our products, 
          and we suspect that an  experienced  professional  will  have  no
          trouble  figuring out how to use the Arrowsoft Assembler with the
          information given; second, the program is, after all, free and we 
          feel that the quality of this assembler will more that compensate 
          you for the time you spend learning to use it.  
          
          Please note that this is NOT a supported product.  If you contact 
          us, we will be happy to discuss our line of software but we  will
          NOT answer questions about the Arrowsoft Assembler.  
          
          Again, we thank you for giving our product a try.

          of  Microsoft  Corporation.  'Arrowsoft', 'Arrowsoft Professional

                                      OVERVIEW
          
          The  Arrowsoft Assembler takes as its input 8086, 8088, 80186 and
          80286 assembly language source  files  and  produces  relocatable
          object  modules  which may be linked and run under the MS-DOS and
          PC-DOS operating systems.  The syntax of the  input  files  is  a
          superset  of  that  accepted  by  the  Microsoft  Macro Assembler
          (versions 3.0 and later).  In fact, most programs written for the 
          Microsoft product should assemble without modification  with  the
          Arrowsoft Assembler.  
          
          The  remaining sections of this manual will cover, in this order,
          assembler command line options,  input  language  specifications,
          linking  and execution of assembled object modules, and assembler
          error messages.  
          
          
          
                          INVOKING THE ARROWSOFT ASSEMBLER
          
          You may run the Arrowsoft  Assembler  interactively  or  directly
          from the   DOS   command   line.      To   invoke  the  assembler
          interactively, simply type

          Arrowsoft Assembler v1.00                            User's Guide


                   asm
          
          at the DOS prompt and follow the ensuing instructions.    To  run
          the assembler non-interactively, use the following syntax: 
          
                   asm source [,object] [,list] [,xref] [options] [;]
          
          where  'source'  is  a  filespec  for  the  source  file (default
          extension .ASM), 'object' is  a  filespec  for  the  object  file
          (default  extension  .OBJ),  'list' is a filespec for the listing
          file (default extension .LST) and 'xref' is a  filespec  for  the
          cross-reference  file  (default  extension  .CRF).  Note that all
          filespecs may consist of a drive letter, a pathname,  a  filename
          and an  extension.    If  the  object  file is not specified, the
          assembler will use the source filename with the  .OBJ  extension.
          If  the  list  and  cross-reference  files are not specified, the
          assembler will not produce them.  Finally, the semicolon (;) will 
          force the assembler to assume default values for any  unspecified
          parameters.  
          
          
          
                                    OPTION CODES
          
          The options  list  consists of a sequence of option codes.  These
          option codes consist of a slash (/) or dash (-) followed  by  one
          or more letters, case being insignificant.  Most of these options 
          are compatible with Microsoft conventions.  
          
                   /A             Write segments in alphabetical order
                   /Bnumber       Set buffer size
                   /Dsymbol       Define assembler symbol
                   /E             Generate 8087/80287 emulator code
                   /Ipath         Set 'include' search path
                   /ML            Case sensitive internal labels
                   /MX            Case sensitive external and public labels
                   /MU            Convert labels to uppercase
                   /R             Generate 8087/80287 floating point code
                   /S             Write segments in source code order
                   /X             Include false conditionals in listing
                   /Z             Display error lines on screen
          
          
          Many  of  these  command  line  options are self explanatory; for
          whose which aren't, see the descriptions below: 
          
          
          /B Set Buffer Size 
          
          Sets the size of the buffer used to hold the source  file  during
          assembly.   The  'number'  is the number of 1K pages reserved for
          use as a buffer.  You may  set  the  buffer  size  to  any  value
          between  1K  and  63K;  default  buffer  size is 32K. Note that a
          larger buffer can speed assembly of large files considerably.  
          
          
          /E Generate 8087/80287 Emulator Code 
          


                                         -2-


          Arrowsoft Assembler v1.00                            User's Guide


          If you are writing programs for use with the  8087/80287  numeric
          processor on a machine which does not have the processor, and you 
          have  an  8087/80287  emulator  library  available, the /E option
          directs the assembler to generate code for the emulator.  
          
          
          /I Set 'include' file search paths 
          
          You may direct the assembler to search up to  5  directories  for
          'include'  files  by  including  a  '/Ipath'  command for EACH of
          them.  For example,  to  set  the  search  paths  '\bin\lib'  and
          '\asm\lib',   include   the   following  in  your  options  list:
          /I\bin\lib/I\asm\lib.  
          
          
          /R 
          
          This option directs the assembler to generate floating point code 
          for the  8087/80287  numeric  processor.    Note  that   programs
          assembled  with  the  '/R' option will run ONLY on machines which
          have an 8087/80287 installed.  
          
          
          
                             ARROWSOFT ASSEMBLY LANGUAGE
          
          As we mentioned earlier, the Arrowsoft  Assembly  Language  is  a
          superset of the well-known Microsoft Macro Assembler Language. We 
          modeled  our system after Microsoft's for two reasons: First, the
          language has a flexible and moderately powerful  macro  facility;
          second,  and for this public domain project most important, there
          is a plethora of third-party books which explain how  to  program
          using the  Microsoft product.  We recommend that you purchase one
          of these guides if  you  are  not  familiar  with  8086  assembly
          language.   If  you  would  like  to  take  advantage of the many
          extensions to the Microsoft Language we have implemented  in  the
          Arrowsoft Assembler, you must do one of two things: Try to figure 
          them  out  for  yourself  (using  experimentation, disassembly or
          anything else you can think of); or  you  can  contact  us  about
          purchasing  the  Arrowsoft Professional Assembler, which includes
          the complete documentation.  Again, please DO NOT CALL  us  about
          the  Arrowsoft  Assembler;  we  will  not answer any questions or
          provide clues as  to  how  to  access  the  assembler's  advanced
          features.  
          
          
          
                   LINKING AND EXECUTING ARROWSOFT OBJECT MODULES
          
          The Arrowsoft Assembler produces relocatable object modules which 
          are  compatible  with  the Microsoft 8086 Object Linker (versions
          3.0 and later).   This  means  that  programs  assembled  by  the
          Arrowsoft   Assembler   may   be   linked  with  other  Microsoft
          Linker-compatible programs  generated  by  other  assemblers  and
          compilers.   If  you  need  more  information  on  how to use the
          Microsoft 8086 Object Linker, see your DOS or Microsoft  language
          manual.

          By the way, we would like you to know about Arrowsofts Super Link 
          8086/8086  Object  Link  Utility.  Super  Link  is a full-service
          overlaying linker which is fully compatible  with  the  Microsoft
          8086  Object  Linker,  yet  much  faster  and far more versatile.
          Contact us at the address on the cover of this  manual  for  more
          information.  
          
          
          
                              ASSEMBLER ERROR MESSAGES
          
          An  Arrowsoft  Assembler  error report consists of three parts: A
          source file line number,  an  error  number  and  a  terse  error
          description.   In  most  cases,  the  error messages, in spite of
          their brevity, are self explanatory.    However,  for  those  few
          messages  which  require  addtional  elaboration,  we  offer  the
          following explanations: 
          
          
          2 Internal error 
          
          This message will appear only if an  error  occurred  within  the
          assembler itself.    If  you  see  this  message,  please send an
          assembly listing of  the  source  file  and  any  other  relevant
          information (DOS version, assembler version, etc.) to the address 
          on the cover of this manual.  
          
          
          68 Can't reach with segment reg 
          
          You have not issued the appropriate ASSUME directive.  
          
          
          99 Line too long expanding <symbol> 
          
          Expanding  an  EQU-defined symbol would result in a line too long
          for the assembler to handle.  Check for inadvertent recursion  in
          the symbol.  
          
          
          Out of Memory 
          
          Either  the source file exceeds the 64K limit of the assembler or
          the symbol table exceeds  its  allocation.    If  this  condition
          occurs,  try  assembling without creating list or cross-reference
          files.  If this doesn't work, try dividing your source code  into
          several smaller source files and assembling them separately.  The 
          resulting code  may  then be linked with a link utility.  (Again,
          we can't resist pointing  out  that  the  Arrowsoft  Professional
          Assembler  uses ALL available memory for the assembly process; in
          fact, it will assemble a file of arbitrary  size,  regardless  of
          memory limitations.) 
          
          
          Internal Error 
          
          See the explanation for error number 2 above.

          Our  real reason for giving you this program free of charge is to
          encourage you to purchase our commercial product,  the  Arrowsoft
          Professional Assembler. The program you have now differs from the 
          full   program  in  only  three  respects:  (1)  It  includes  no
          documentation  for  those  language  features  which  extend  the
          Microsoft  Macro Assembly Language (although they are implemented
          by the public domain version); (2) the maximum input file size is 
          limited to 64K bytes; and (3) it is not supported via our 24 hour 
          toll-free help line (in fact, it is not supported at all by  us).
          With these 3 exceptions, the program you now have is identical to 
          the Professional Assembler.  
          
          If  you  decide you'd like to purchase the Arrowsoft Professional
          Assembler, send a postcard requesting our catalog to the  address
          on the  cover  of  this  manual.    Our catalog will show you our
          entire line of professional  software  development  products  and
          will  convince you that our quality and prices are as competitive
          as you will find anywhere.  
          
          
          
                           CONCLUDING REMARKS AND CREDITS
          
          Again, we would like to thank you for trying  our  product.    We
          hope  that  the  remarks  we've  made  concerning our programming
          products (Arrowsoft Professional Assembler and  Super  Link  8086
          Object  Linker)  have  piqued  your  curiosity enough that you'll
          write to us for more information.  Further, we hope that actually 
          using one of our products has convinced you of our dedication  to
          quality and  performance.  Finally, we hope to welcome you to our
          growing family of satisfied customers.  
          
          Even if you don't buy anything from us, you can do  us  a  favor.
          We  want you to distribute this product to all of your friends by
          any means possible.  You may post it to bulletin boards, offer it 
          through your computer club or just copy it and  pass  it  around.
          We  only  ask that (1) you charge nothing for the software beyond
          reasonable copying and disk costs and (2) that you distribute the 
          two  files   (ASM.EXE   and   ASM.DOC)   together   and   without
          modification.  
          
          The  Arrowsoft Assembler was written by Kaplan 'Kap' Morovitz and
          tested by the programming staff at Arrowsoft. Since 'Kap'  writes
