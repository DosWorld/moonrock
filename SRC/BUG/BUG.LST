Fixed bugs                                                       MRC v0.17
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

- mypath had a stray null (0) appended to it
- fkill() with string constant would sometimes cause "invalid pointer
  to free" runtime error
- using a doubleword variable in a FOR...NEXT loop produced invalid
  label format (no preceding 'LL' before the unique number)
- using a doubleword variable in a FOR...NEXT loop with 386+ code
  generation enabled produced invalid memory reference (missing right
  square bracket)
- replaced random number algorithm AGAIN
- "db ?" replaced with "db 1 dup (?)" (and dw, dd etc) to keep ArrowSoft
  assembler and MASM from assembling unitialised data as "db 0" when
  compiling for EXE output
  resultant executable should be at least 1k smaller
- FOR...NEXT with byte variable wrote a word rather than byte, and thus
  corrupted the next byte location
- FOR...NEXT with byte variable loop code generation tightened (no
  conversion to word)
- array operations with byte variable as element pointer left top 8 bits
  of 16 bit pointer undefined -- under some circumstances this may
  corrupt other variables or string memory
- language dependent OBJ production did not include critical error
  handler in output ASM, which could therefore not be assembled without
  error
- during compile, current file name was incorrectly reported if include
  files were nested more than 2 files deep
- _str_copy_qb function (convert QB string to MR string) trashed ES
  register
- fossil routines enabled ^C/^K checking rather than disabling it, which
  meant inbound data was not fully 8 bit transparent
